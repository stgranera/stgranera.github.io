<h1>Why I design...</h1>
  	<p>Graphic designers are not only people that know how to push keys <br> 
  		on a keyboard to make things pretty but are problem solvers. As <br> 
  		a designer I find myself taking very complex and abstract ideas and <br> 
  		deconstructing them to their simplest form. I want my work to be <br>
  		easily understood but not so simple that my works becomes dull <br>
  		and uninteresting, this is the paradox of being a graphic designer.<br>
  		Simplicity is beautiful and some times cannot be defined by a language,<br>
  		but getting to that point can be difficult. Producing work that anyone <br>
  		from any cultural background can understand is my goal. Every artist <br>
  		from any field wishes that their work could aspire and break boundaries,<br>
  		as do I wish for my own work. I have found that the fundamentals of <br>
  		design play a great deal into the quality of work that one produces. <br>
  		Without the fundamentals and motivation to solve problems I know my <br>
  		work can only go so far. I push myself to think abstractly and try to be <br> 
  		inspired by all things. I want my work to be as open and diverse like the <br>
  		world around me. Loud and bold colors from the pop art era and graffiti <br>
  	 	have always demanded my attention. The idea that art work can be <br>
  	 	very in your face has intrigued me, and want the fluidity that this kind <br>
  	 	of work has to be represented in my work.  Keeping in mind the idea of <br>
  	 	repetition, organization, transition and reinforcement has helped me take <br>
  	 	these abstract and complex problem, and morph them into works of art <br>
  	 	that visual communicate with the audience.</p>
